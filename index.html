      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="pro">I'm Arush, just a 12 year old kiddo who's a musician and a coder. I live in India, love playing the guitar and of course, coding. I did not like coding at first, but in time I started to like it and now I'm <em>pretty good</em>
        at it

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="code" src="images/code.png" alt="coding">
        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I started out on code.org but it was just logic and then I started learning HTML I made the same site but, it got deleted so I'm making this site again. I know CSS, Bootstrap, and a little bit Javascript ES6.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="draw" src="images/canvas.png " alt="drawing-on-canvas">
        <h3 class="right">Drawing</h3>
        <p class="right">I've done some sketches over time with a pencil. I've drawn some sceneries too with paint and oil pastels. Over time, I am pretty good at it. I mostly always draw from Cartooning Club How To Draw (Sketches and Chibi).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="music" src="images/guitar.png" alt="guitar">
        <h3>Playing Music</h3>
        <p>This was neglected at first. I would never play it. I'd only play it about once a month. But once, I played such a song, that I practice everyday. I kinda am around 3 stars at fingerpicking but I'm catching on and now I'm better. I learn
          from Guitar Zero2Hero and Tab Sheeet Music.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="fball" src="images/soccer.png" alt="soccer">
        <h3 class="right">Football</h3>
        <p class="right">I might be the next Ronaldo or Messi in this. I used to play a lot of football and I even tackled many of my friends because I'm a pretty fast runner. My team was once lagging by 8 goals but then I scored 6 goals and my
          friends scored 4. We won the game</p>
